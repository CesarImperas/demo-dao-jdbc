# About the Project
This project demonstrates how to implement the DAO (Data Access Object) pattern with JDBC (Java Database Connectivity). 
It provides a practical approach to managing database operations such as creating, reading, updating, and deleting (CRUD) data from a relational database using JDBC. 
The project shows how to separate data access logic from business logic, improving the maintainability and scalability of Java applications.
